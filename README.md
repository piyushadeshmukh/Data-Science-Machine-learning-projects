+ [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool
+ [Pandas Profiling](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/) - generate reports from dataframe
+ [Geo Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/geopandas/) - support for geographic data to pandas objects.
+ [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
+ [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An end-to-end open source machine learning platform
+ [Keras](https://keras.io/) - Deep Learning framework
+ [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - Natural Language Toolkit

#### Data Visualization libraries
+ [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
