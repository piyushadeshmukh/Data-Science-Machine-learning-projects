1. Problem statement: Given the dataset consisting of driver images in car and corresponding labels for 10 nos. categories (e.g. safe driving, texting, talking etc.), your task is to build a classification model to predict the category for that image.
2. Dataset link: After creating an account on Kaggle, go to this competition page (https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection) and Join Competition. After joining the competition, you can either download the data on your local machine or you can use Kaggle kernel (like jupyter notebook) to build and train your model (recommended as it provides you with GPU computing to train your neural network and no need to download the dataset locally).
